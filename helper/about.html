          <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <div>
              <p>
                <strong> Fitness Coaching</strong> was born from a simple but powerful idea: fitness should be inclusive, 
                inspiring, and sustainable.
              </p>
              <p>
                Founded in 2025 by Mr. Muster Man, a certified fitness coach and lifelong wellness enthusiast, 
                our journey started with a few kettlebells in a garage and a mission to make fitness approachable. 
                Over the years, we've grown into a thriving coaching community serving hundreds of clients across 
                Germany, both in-person and online.
              </p>
              <p>
                What started as personal training sessions has now evolved into a holistic fitness coaching platform 
                that includes personalized programs, nutritional guidance, mental health support, and a thriving 
                online community.
              </p>
            </div>
          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <div>
              <p>
                To empower individuals of all backgrounds and fitness levels to lead stronger, healthier, and more 
                confident lives through personalized coaching, evidence-based practices, and unwavering support.
              </p>
              <p>
                We're here to help you:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Build physical and mental strength</li>
                <li>Break through fitness plateaus</li>
                <li>Create lasting, healthy habits</li>
                <li>Celebrate every step of your progress</li>
              </ul>
            </div>  
          <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
            <div>
              <p>
                At <strong>Fitness Coaching</strong>, we believe in balance, not burnout. Fitness is a journey â€” not a punishment or a race.
              </p>
              <p>
                We're guided by a few key principles:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Individuality matters</strong> - No two bodies or goals are the same. We customize every plan to meet your needs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Consistency beats intensity</strong> - It's not about crushing one workout; it's about showing up over time.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Sustainable change</strong> - Quick fixes don't last. We focus on long-term results through healthy habits.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Mind-body connection </strong> - True fitness includes physical strength, mental resilience, and emotional wellbeing.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>   
          <h2>Join Our Community</h2>
            <div>
              <p>
                We believe fitness is more powerful when it's shared. Join a community of people who are pushing limits, 
                lifting each other up, and living better â€” one rep, one step, and one goal at a time.
